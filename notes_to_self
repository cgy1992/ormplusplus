ORM todo:
enable using NULL
let loadMany take a limit parameter
use loadMany without taking Class as parameter
implement saveMany
use eloquent like where (decorator design pattern)
add order by

when user tries to select where, he will have to type column name in snake case
any better practice to that ?
